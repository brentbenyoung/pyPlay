# This code will not multiply the num by 3 but instead print the given number 3 times

#get a number from the user
num = input("Enter a number:")
#multiply the number by 3
answer = num * 3
#print the result
print("Your number tripled is : " + answer)

#In order to multiply the num by 3 you must do so as such:

#get a number from the user
number = input("Enter a number:")
#turn the input into a number and multiply the number by 3
multbythree = int(number) * 3
#print the result, while turning the answer back into a string
print("Your number tripled is: " + str(multbythree))
